What is this?
-------------

This is an unofficial fork of Scott Garlands NNTP Client Library.

The original can be found on CodePlex:
http://nntpclientlib.codeplex.com/


Why?
----
I first pulled down a copy of this library from CodePlex on 03/05/2012.
Trying to connect to my ISPs NNTP server caused some issues, and it didn't implement SSL support.

It looks like the original project is fairly dead, so I've forked the project here to track my changes to it.



What improvements have been made?
---------------------------------
Since forking the library, I have implemented the following features/fixes:
* SSL Support
* Fix long standing authentication issue in library
